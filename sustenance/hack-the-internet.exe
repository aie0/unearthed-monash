mi go reng
Mi go reng noodles can only be described as the most delicious, delectable, palatable feast that one can ever enjoy. mi go reng originated in indo (a country which consists of many islands), and before long, had whored / pimped its little packet filled goodness to many fortunate first-world countries. you can purchase this ‘orgasmic treat of salty deliciousness’ (as defined by wikipedia) from many supermarkets, eg, woolies and coles , and your local forthcoming asian shop.
